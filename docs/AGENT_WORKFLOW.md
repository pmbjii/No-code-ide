5. **Save** the workflow for future use

## Technical Architecture

### Backend (AIService.js)

```javascript
// Agent Manager
class AgentManager {
  // Agent definitions with specialized prompts
  // Workflow definitions with step sequences
  // Execution tracking and logging
  // Result parsing and combination
}

// Workflow Execution
async runWorkflow(workflowId, input, options) {
  // Sequential or parallel execution
  // Error handling and recovery
  // Result combination and prioritization
}
```

### Frontend (AgentWorkflowPanel.jsx)

```javascript
// Real-time execution monitoring
// Visual workflow builder
// Expandable result display
// Custom workflow creation
```

### Integration Points

- **Chat Panel**: Natural language workflow triggering
- **Sidebar**: Dedicated agent workflow panel
- **Editor Context**: File-aware analysis
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket-based progress tracking

## Configuration

### Agent Configuration

Each agent can be configured with:
- **System Prompt**: Specialized instructions for the AI
- **Model Selection**: Choose the best AI model for each task
- **Temperature**: Control creativity vs consistency
- **Max Tokens**: Limit response length

### Workflow Configuration

Workflows support:
- **Sequential vs Parallel**: Control execution order
- **Error Handling**: Continue or stop on failures
- **Result Combination**: How to merge multiple agent outputs
- **Custom Steps**: Add your own agents to workflows

## Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Start with Quick Analysis** for initial code review
2. **Use Code Review Workflow** for comprehensive analysis
3. **Create Custom Workflows** for project-specific needs
4. **Review Results Carefully** - AI suggestions need human validation
5. **Combine Multiple Workflows** for thorough analysis

### For Developers

1. **Extend AgentManager** to add new agents
2. **Create Specialized Prompts** for domain-specific analysis
3. **Implement Custom Parsers** for structured results
4. **Add Workflow Templates** for common use cases
5. **Integrate with CI/CD** for automated code review

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Agent Execution Fails**
   - Check AI model configuration
   - Verify API keys and quotas
   - Review error logs in console

2. **Slow Performance**
   - Use Quick Analysis for faster results
